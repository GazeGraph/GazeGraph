# DesktopActivity Eye Tracking Dataset

This repository contains download links and the introduction of the DesktopActivity Eye Tracking dataset for SenSys 2020 paper entitled ["GazeGraph: Graph-based Few-Shot Cognitive Context Sensingfrom Human Visual Behavior"] () by [Guohao Lan](https://guohao.netlify.app/), [Bailey Heit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bailey-heit-b35a23152/), [Tim Scargill](https://sites.duke.edu/timscargill/), and [Maria Gorlatova](https://maria.gorlatova.com/). 

## Examples of the data collection process for the DesktopActivity dataset
We use the Pupil Core head-mounted eye tracker to collect the eye movement behavior of eight subjects when performing six desktop activities. To give an example of how the data collection was performed, we share the videos that are captured by the scene camera of the eye tracker when a subject is performing the six activities: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/brw160oe48vcxfj/AACk4eQ0ThLdrppmaxuMQvw9a?dl=0

There are six videos and each corresponds to one of the six activities. In each of the videos, the estimated gazes (i.e., the green circle) and the images of the pupils are overlaid with the user's field-of-view in real-time. 

## DesktopActivity dataset
The dataset will be made publicly available later.
