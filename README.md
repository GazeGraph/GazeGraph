## Examples of the data collection process for the SedentaryActivity dataset
We use the Pupil Core head-mounted eye trakcer in our data collection. To give an example of how the data collection was performed, we share the videos that are captured by the scene camera when a subject is performing the six sedentary activities: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/brw160oe48vcxfj/AACk4eQ0ThLdrppmaxuMQvw9a?dl=0

There are six videos and each corresponds to one of the six activities. In each of the videos, the estimated gazes (i.e., the green circle) and the images of the pupils are overlaid with the user's field-of-view in real-time.
