## Examples of the data collection process for the SedentaryActivity dataset
We are using the Pupil Core head-mounted eye trakcer for this data collection. Videos that are captured by the scene camera when a subject is performing the six sedentary activities can be found in this link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/brw160oe48vcxfj/AACk4eQ0ThLdrppmaxuMQvw9a?dl=0

Each of six videos corresponds to one of the six activities. The estimated gazes and the images of the pupils are overlaid with the user's field-of-view in real-time. These videos give an clear example of how the data collection was performed.
